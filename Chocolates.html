    <h1> CHOCOLATES </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>MILK CHOCOLATE</h2>
    <P>Milk chocolate, as the name implies, contains at least 12% milk and must contain a minimum of 10% chocolate liquor (which is, to recap, pure cocoa butter and cocoa solids), though higher quality milk chocolates often contain as much as 30-40% cocoa.</P>

    <br>
    <h2>WHITE CHOCOLATE</h2>
    <P>You hear chocolate purists say all the time: "White chocolate isn't chocolate." Which is sort of true, because it doesn't contain any of the cocoa solids. It's effectively pure cocoa butter and sugar (according to FDA standards, at least 20% cocoa butter and 14% milk, cream, or milk solids). </P>

    <br>
    <h2>DARK CHOCOLATE</h2>
    <p> Very dark chocolate can be as high as 80%, but that much cacao mass can make the chocolate very bitter and brittle, which many find unpleasant to eat. For baking and nibbling, I like to go with dark chocolates in the 65-70% range because theyâ€™re intense without being overpowering.</p>
