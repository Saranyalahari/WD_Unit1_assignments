	<h1> PARAGRAPH </h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	<p>Paragraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. </p>
<br>
<p>It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
<p> The purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.</p>
